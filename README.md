# git_playground

I use this repo to learn using github.

I have put a documentation of my thoughts in the [wiki](https://github.com/comfortliner/git_playground/wiki).

But there are tons of interesting content in the internet:
 * The first point of interest should alway be the 
   * [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en) or 
   * [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/), the git community book.
 * [git-Der einfache Einstieg](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.de.html) provides a nice overview of the basic techniques.
 * A visual [git guide](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)
 * [Try git](https://try.github.io/) teaches you how to use git in 15 minutes.
 * Live saving advice from [ohshitgit](https://ohshitgit.com/)
 * Last but not least [learn version control](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/videos/) with a couple of video explanations
